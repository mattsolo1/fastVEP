# Medical-geneticist review queue (v6 benchmark)

This document curates the variants where fastVEP and ClinVar 2-star+
disagree most strongly — i.e. where the classifier commits to a
directional call that contradicts the expert-panel review. It excludes
cases where fastVEP calls VUS due to insufficient automatable evidence
(those need data, not curation).

## Top-line numbers

| Outcome | Count | What it is |
|---------|------:|------------|
| **Truth-not-annotated (NoCall)** | **1** | A single regulatory variant chr6:99593111 G>C (PRDM13, North Carolina macular dystrophy, OMIM 616842.0002). Falls upstream of any transcript so VEP picks `intergenic_variant` and no ACMG block is emitted. Pathogenicity here is via a non-coding regulatory mechanism that the standard ACMG framework doesn't address — flag as "out-of-scope-of-ACMG" and review manually. |
| **Opposite-direction discrepancies** | **112** | Variants where fastVEP calls P/LP and ClinVar says LB/B (or vice versa). The candidate set for MD review. |
| Same-class differences (P/LP/B/LB ↔ VUS) | 9,888 | These are *not* opposite-direction; they reflect missing manual-curation evidence (PS3 functional, PP1 segregation, etc.) by design. |
| Same-direction calls | 473,421 | Classifier and ClinVar agree on direction. |

The single NoCall is **not** a classifier bug — it's a recognized gap
between coding-variant ACMG and non-coding regulatory pathogenicity.
Recommendation: fastVEP should ship a flag `--report-noncoding` that
emits a stub ACMG block for upstream/3'UTR/intergenic calls so they
appear in downstream review queues rather than vanishing.

## Curated review file

`discrepancies_for_md_review.tsv` ranks all 112 opposite-direction
cases by:

1. **3-star (expert panel) > 2-star** — the truth is more reliable, so
   classifier disagreement is more interesting.
2. **Pathogenic↔Benign (full reversal) > LP↔LB** — extremity weighted
   higher.
3. **Number of criteria fired** — more evidence on the disagreeing
   side = more confident classifier disagreement = stronger candidate
   for re-curation.

Built by `analysis/acmg_benchmark/real_data/04_build_md_review_table.py`
which joins three sources:

- `data/benchmark/output_v6/discrepancies.tsv` — the raw concordance
  output
- `data/benchmark/clinvar_2star.vcf` — for the full ClinVar INFO
- `data/benchmark/output_v6/opposite_direction.fastvep.vcf` — a
  re-annotation of the 112 discrepancy variants with `--hgvs` so the
  HGVSc / HGVSp fields are populated (the full-benchmark VCF.gz omits
  HGVS to stay small)

distilled from the same JSON that fastVEP's classifier consumes. Empty
values mean the data source isn't loaded or the variant is absent from it.

### Coverage on the 112 discrepancies

Empty cells reflect either (a) the data source doesn't apply to the
variant (REVEL is missense-only; SpliceAI doesn't fire on far-from-
splice variants) or (b) the variant is truly absent from the source
(gnomAD `_allAf` empty = variant not in gnomAD = PM2_Supporting fires
in the classifier per the v6 fix).

| Score | Populated | Note |
|-------|----------:|------|
| REVEL | 60 / 112 | Only missense variants; matches missense subset |
| PhyloP | 74 / 112 | Variants where the position has a gnomAD record (PhyloP is distilled from gnomAD INFO) |
| SpliceAI max_ds | 71 / 112 | Same gnomAD-distillation coverage |
| gnomAD allAf | 59 / 112 | The other 53 are absent from gnomAD — PM2_Supporting fires |

## Top 7 (3-star expert-panel opposite calls)

These are the **highest-priority** cases — the ClinVar review-panel
call is from a Variant Curation Expert Panel.

| # | Gene | Variant | HGVSp | ClinVar (3*) | fastVEP | Criteria fired | Review hypothesis |
|---|------|---------|-------|------------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **OTOF**  | chr2:26463969 C>G | p.Glu1700Gln | Pathogenic | LB | PS1, BS2, BP4 | Same-AA-as-known-pathogenic + healthy-homozygote conflict. Likely a hypomorphic allele where heterozygotes are healthy but compound-het with another pathogenic allele causes auditory neuropathy. ACMG combiner correctly hits VUS-conflicting; ClinVar's panel has functional/segregation evidence we don't have. |
| 2 | **CYP1B1** | chr2:38075207 C>T | p.Gly61Glu | Pathogenic | LB | PS1, BS2, BP4 | Same pattern as OTOF — known pathogenic-by-AA but observed in healthy homozygotes. Recessive primary congenital glaucoma; this is OMIM 601771.0003. Clinical variability is well-documented. Re-evaluate whether BS2 should be silenced for genes where homozygous healthy adults *can* exist (incomplete penetrance). |
| 3 | **SCN2A**  | chr2:165344715 A>G | p.Lys908Arg | **Benign** | **LP** | PM1, PM2_Supporting, PM5, PP2, BP4 | Five criteria all firing in the pathogenic direction (with BP4 from REVEL ≤ 0.290). ClinVar says benign. **This is the strongest classifier-disagrees-with-panel case.** Worth checking the actual ClinVar submission rationale — possible that the variant is in a benign domain despite the hotspot context. |
| 4 | **MSH2**   | chr2:47416297 G>A | p.Gly315Val | Likely Benign | LP | PS1, PM1, BP4 | Lynch syndrome locus — same-AA-as-pathogenic call. ClinVar has hypothesized hypomorphic / VUS reclassification; check current InSiGHT classification. |
| 5 | **MYOC**   | chr1:171652476 G>A | p.Arg46Ter | Likely Benign | LP | PVS1, PM2_Supporting | Stop_gained in MYOC (juvenile open-angle glaucoma, OMIM 601652). PVS1+PM2 → LP per ClinGen SVI rule. Glaucoma panel may have downgraded based on incomplete penetrance / variable expressivity in healthy elderly. Worth checking gene-specific PVS1 calibration (is MYOC truly haploinsufficient?). |
| 6 | **MSH6**   | chr2:47806652 GTAAC>G | (splice) | Likely Benign | LP | PVS1, PM2_Supporting | Splice donor variant in Lynch-syndrome locus. PVS1 fires on canonical splice. Likely a panel re-classification based on RNA studies showing tolerated transcript or in-frame skip. |
| 7 | **MSH6**   | chr2:47806842 T>TTTGA | p.Lys1358AspfsTer2 | Likely Benign | LP | PVS1, PM2_Supporting | Frameshift variant in MSH6. Same pattern — panel may have downgraded based on functional / segregation evidence. |

## Top 20 (all 2-star+ opposite-direction)

See `discrepancies_for_md_review.tsv` for the full ranked list.
Notable patterns:

- **PS1 + BS2** conflict (~30 % of opposites): a same-AA-as-pathogenic
  match co-occurring with healthy-adult homozygote observations. This
  is the *literal* signature of incomplete-penetrance / hypomorphic
  alleles. ACMG-AMP doesn't have a clean rule for these — manual
  curation needs to choose which evidence dominates.
- **PVS1 + BS2** (~10 %): null-variant pathogenic by mechanism but
  ClinVar has BS2 from healthy adult homozygotes. Likely needs RNA /
  protein functional data the classifier can't see.
- **MSH6, MSH2, MUTYH** appear repeatedly — Lynch-syndrome and
  MAP-related genes with active expert-panel re-curation. These are
  worth a sweep through current InSiGHT classifications.
- **PCSK9** (7 cases) — gain-of-function disease gene where the
  ClinGen Familial Hypercholesterolemia VCEP recently re-curated many
  variants; the v6 calls predate the latest VCEP guidance.

## Recommended workflow

1. Open `discrepancies_for_md_review.tsv` in a spreadsheet.
2. Filter `stars == 3` (top 7 cases) — review first.
3. For each case, look up `rcv` in ClinVar and read the assertion
   evidence (especially PS3 functional and PP1 segregation rationale).
4. If the panel call is well-supported, consider whether fastVEP needs
   a per-gene config override (e.g. silence BS2 for genes with
   well-documented incomplete penetrance, or downgrade PVS1 for genes
   where some null variants are tolerated).
5. If the panel call seems out-of-date, flag for ClinVar re-submission.
6. For the remaining 105 2-star cases, batch-review by gene
   (the file is sorted by gene within priority).

## What's NOT in this list (and why)

- **All 9,888 P/LP → VUS cases**: not a wrong call, just missing
  evidence. Fix is data (PS3 functional, PP1 segregation, PP4
  phenotype-specific) not curation.
- **The 1 NoCall (PRDM13 regulatory variant)**: out of ACMG scope.
- **Any same-direction call**: classifier and panel agree on direction
  (P↔LP or B↔LB) — these are concordant even if not exact-match.
