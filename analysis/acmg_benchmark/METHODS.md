# ACMG-AMP Variant Classification in fastVEP: Methods and Benchmark

## Overview

fastVEP implements the 28 ACMG-AMP evidence criteria from Richards et al.
2015 plus published ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working
Group refinements, producing a 5-tier classification: Pathogenic (P),
Likely Pathogenic (LP), Uncertain Significance (VUS), Likely Benign (LB),
Benign (B).

This document reflects the state after the SVI alignment series (PR1–PR10).
Each criterion section includes the ClinGen reference and any deviations
from a strict reading of the SVI text. A per-criterion "Limitations"
column flags criteria that fall back to legacy or conservative behavior
until additional pipeline data is wired in.

## Implementation

### Criteria Coverage

Of the 28 ACMG-AMP criteria, 18 are fully automatable from variant-level
data and are implemented in fastVEP. The classifier records the source
that drove each call in `details.pp3_source` / `details.ps1_path` /
`details.inheritance_basis` etc., so every classification is auditable.

#### Pathogenic Criteria (11 automated)

| Criterion | Strength | Description | Data Source / Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| PVS1 | VS / Strong / Moderate / Supporting (Abou Tayoun 2018 decision tree) | Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice, start-loss, whole-gene deletion) in LOF-intolerant gene | Consequence + gnomAD constraints + transcript NMD prediction + critical-region check + alt-start distance |
| PS1 | Strong | Same amino acid change as known pathogenic missense, **or** same RNA outcome for canonical splice (Walker 2023) | ClinVar protein-position index + same-position pathogenic splice catalog |
| PS2 | Strong | Confirmed de novo (full trio) | VCF genotype (proband + both parents) + DP/GQ thresholds |
| PS3 | Strong | Functional studies | Not automatable — NotEvaluated |
| PS4 | Strong | Prevalence in affected vs controls | **NotEvaluated by default** — requires case-control statistics. Optional legacy proxy via `use_clinvar_stars_as_ps4_proxy` |
| PM1 | Moderate | Mutational hotspot / functional domain | ClinVar protein-position density. Capped against PP3 per Pejaver 2022 |
| PM2 | Supporting* | Absent / extremely rare in population | gnomAD raw AF, **inheritance-aware** (AD/unknown: AC=0; AR: AF ≤ 0.00007) — SVI v1.0 |
| PM3 | Supporting/Moderate/Strong/VeryStrong | In trans with pathogenic (recessive) | **SVI PM3 v1.0 points-based**: P / LP companion × phasing × hom-occurrence → 0.5 / 1.0 / 2.0 / 4.0 thresholds |
| PM4 | Moderate | Protein length change | Consequence (in-frame indel, stop-loss) |
| PM5 | Moderate | Novel missense at known pathogenic position | ClinVar protein-position index (different alt AA) |
| PM6 | Moderate | Assumed de novo (partial trio) | VCF genotype (proband + ≥1 parent). Mutually exclusive with PS2 |
| PP2 | Supporting | Missense in constrained gene | gnomAD missense Z-score ≥ 3.09 |
| PP3 | Supporting / Moderate / Strong (Pejaver 2022 + Walker 2023) | Computational pathogenic evidence | REVEL (missense only) or SpliceAI ≥ 0.2 (Supporting only) |
| PP4 | Supporting | Phenotype-specific | Not automatable — NotEvaluated |
| PP5 | Supporting | Reputable source | **Disabled by default** per ClinGen SVI |

*PM2 downgraded from Moderate to Supporting per ClinGen SVI v1.0.

#### Benign Criteria (7 automated)

| Criterion | Strength | Description | Data Source / Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| BA1 | Standalone | Common variant (AF > 5%) | gnomAD max population AF, with **AN ≥ 2000** minimum (gnomAD v4 / SVI March 2024). Honors the **9-variant Ghosh 2018 BA1 exception list** |
| BS1 | Strong | Greater than expected frequency | gnomAD AF (gene-specific or default 0.01); same AN minimum as BA1 |
| BS2 | Strong | Observed in healthy adults | gnomAD homozygote count + ClinGen GDV inheritance (or OMIM legacy) |
| BS3 | Strong | Functional studies — no damage | Not automatable — NotEvaluated |
| BS4 | Strong | Lack of segregation | Not automatable — NotEvaluated |
| BP1 | Supporting | Missense in truncation-disease gene | gnomAD pLI ≥ 0.9 + misZ < 2.0 |
| BP2 | Supporting | In trans / in cis with pathogenic | Companion-variant phasing + ClinGen GDV inheritance (or OMIM legacy) |
| BP3 | Supporting | In-frame indel in repeat region | Consequence + RepeatMasker |
| BP4 | Supporting / Moderate / Strong / **VeryStrong** | Computational benign evidence | REVEL (missense only, **incl. VeryStrong band at REVEL ≤ 0.003**) or SpliceAI ≤ 0.1 (Walker 2023) |
| BP5 | Supporting | Alternate molecular basis | Not automatable — NotEvaluated |
| BP6 | Supporting | Reputable source — benign | **Disabled by default** per ClinGen SVI |
| BP7 | Supporting | Synonymous (mid-exon) or deep-intronic, no splice, not conserved | Consequence + SpliceAI + PhyloP + transcript exon coords. **Walker 2023**: exon-edge exclusion + deep-intronic extension |

**10 criteria require manual curation** and are marked NotEvaluated:
PS3 / PS4 (default) / BS3 / BS4 / PP1 / PP4 / PP5 (disabled) / BP2 (when
unphased) / BP5 / BP6 (disabled).

### Pejaver 2022 Calibrated REVEL Thresholds

REVEL is applied **only to missense variants** per Pejaver 2022. The
single-tool calibration replaces the previous SIFT/PolyPhen/PhyloP/GERP
ensemble (Pejaver explicitly recommends a single calibrated tool over
ad-hoc consensus).

| Direction | Strength | REVEL threshold |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| PP3 | Supporting | ≥ 0.644 |
| PP3 | Moderate   | ≥ 0.773 |
| PP3 | Strong     | ≥ 0.932 |
| BP4 | Supporting | ≤ 0.290 |
| BP4 | Moderate   | ≤ 0.183 |
| BP4 | Strong     | ≤ 0.016 |
| BP4 | **Very Strong** (REVEL only) | ≤ 0.003 |

A single BP4_VeryStrong is mapped to 2× `benign_strong` in the counts so
it satisfies the existing ≥2 BS → Benign rule alone (Tavtigian Bayesian
framework).

### Walker 2023 Splicing Recommendations

- **PP3 splice**: SpliceAI max_ds ≥ 0.2 → PP3 *Supporting* (no Strong from
  SpliceAI alone — Strong splice claims need experimental RNA assay).
- **BP4 splice**: SpliceAI max_ds ≤ 0.1 → BP4 Supporting.
- **Uninformative zone**: 0.10 < max_ds < 0.20 — neither fires.
- **BP7 exon-edge exclusion**: BP7 cannot fire for synonymous at first
  base or last 3 bases of an exon (canonical splice region).
- **BP7 deep-intronic extension**: BP7 may fire for intronic variants
  with offset ≥ 7 (donor side) or ≤ -21 (acceptor side) when SpliceAI is
  low and PhyloP is low.

### PVS1 Decision Tree (Abou Tayoun 2018)

| Strength | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| **PVS1** (Very Strong) | Nonsense/frameshift predicted to undergo NMD; canonical ±1/2 splice predicted to cause NMD; whole-gene deletion in haploinsufficient gene |
| **PVS1_Strong** | NMD-escape in critical functional region |
| **PVS1_Moderate** | NMD-escape, non-critical region, ≥10% protein removed; canonical splice in last exon (NMD unlikely); start-loss with downstream Met ≤100 codons + pathogenic upstream |
| **PVS1_Supporting** | <10% protein removed in non-critical region; start-loss without strong corroborating evidence |

When NMD prediction or other transcript-level signals are missing,
PVS1 falls back to legacy full-strength VeryStrong for backward
compatibility.

### PM2 Inheritance-Aware Threshold (SVI v1.0)

| Inheritance | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| AD / unknown | Strict absence (AC = 0 AND AF = 0) |
| AR | AF ≤ 0.00007 (0.007%) |
| Per-gene override | Wins over inheritance default |

Uses **raw** gnomAD AF (not FAF / popmax). Inheritance is inferred from
ClinGen Gene-Disease Validity (preferred per Abou Tayoun 2018) or OMIM
`genemap2.txt` (legacy). Both populate the same `omim` json_key in the
`.oga` schema.

### PM3 v1.0 Points Scoring (SVI)

| Observation | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Confirmed in-trans + co-occurring **Pathogenic** | 1.0 |
| Confirmed in-trans + co-occurring **Likely Pathogenic** | 0.5 |
| Phase unknown + Pathogenic | 0.5 |
| Phase unknown + Likely Pathogenic | 0.25 |
| Homozygous proband observation | 0.5 (capped at 1.0 total) |

| Total points | Strength |
|--------------|----------|
| ≥ 0.5 | PM3_Supporting |
| ≥ 1.0 | PM3 (Moderate) |
| ≥ 2.0 | PM3_Strong |
| ≥ 4.0 | PM3_VeryStrong |

In-cis companions are excluded from PM3 (those count toward BP2).

### BA1 Exception List (Ghosh 2018)

Nine variants exempt from BA1 despite exceeding the 5% threshold (HFE
c.845G>A p.Cys282Tyr, GJB2 c.109G>A, F2/F5 founder alleles, etc.). Match
on `(gene_symbol, hgvs_c)`, case-insensitive. Configurable via TOML so
VCEPs can extend.

| Gene | Variant | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| ACAD9 | c.-44_-41dupTAAG | VUS |
| ACADS | c.511C>T | VUS |
| BTD | c.1330G>C | Pathogenic — biotinidase deficiency |
| GJB2 | c.109G>A | Pathogenic — DFNB1 hearing loss |
| HFE | c.187C>G | Pathogenic — hemochromatosis |
| HFE | c.845G>A | Pathogenic — hemochromatosis |
| MEFV | c.1105C>T | VUS |
| MEFV | c.1223G>A | VUS |
| PIBF1 | c.1214G>A | VUS |

### Anti-Double-Counting (PP3 Reconciliation)

A post-evaluation reconciliation pass suppresses PP3 (or PM1) under
overlap conditions called out in Pejaver 2022 and Walker 2023:

| Trigger | Suppressed | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| PVS1 fires AND PP3 was driven by SpliceAI | PP3 | Walker 2023 |
| PS1 fires AND PP3 was driven by REVEL | PP3 | Pejaver 2022 |
| PM5 fires AND PP3 was driven by REVEL | PP3 | Pejaver 2022 |
| PP3_Strong + PM1 (combined > Strong cap) | PM1 | Pejaver 2022 |

Suppressed criteria stay in the result with `met=false` and a
`details.suppressed_by_reconcile` note.

### gnomAD v4 AN Minimum (SVI March 2024)

BA1 and BS1 require gnomAD `all_an ≥ 2000` before they can fire. Below
the threshold the criterion is NotEvaluated rather than fired on noisy
estimates. Configurable via `min_an_for_frequency_criteria`.

### Combination Rules (19 = 18 Richards 2015 + 1 SVI Sept 2020)

**Benign:**
1. BA1 standalone → Benign
2. ≥2 BS → Benign

**Pathogenic (8):**
3. PVS + ≥1 PS
4. PVS + ≥2 PM
5. PVS + 1 PM + 1 PP
6. PVS + ≥2 PP
7. ≥2 PS
8. 1 PS + ≥3 PM
9. 1 PS + 2 PM + ≥2 PP
10. 1 PS + 1 PM + ≥4 PP

**Likely Pathogenic (7, includes ClinGen SVI Sept 2020 rule):**
11. PVS + 1 PM
12. **PVS + ≥1 PP** *(ClinGen SVI Sept 2020 — compensates PM2 downgrade; Bayesian Post_P = 0.988)*
13. 1 PS + 1–2 PM
14. 1 PS + ≥2 PP
15. ≥3 PM
16. 2 PM + ≥2 PP
17. 1 PM + ≥4 PP

**Likely Benign (2):**
18. 1 BS + 1 BP
19. ≥2 BP

**Conflict gating (PR9 fix)**: pathogenic and benign rules apply
**independently**. The result is VUS-Conflicting only when **both**
directions reach a definite call (P/LP and B/LB). Otherwise the
directional call wins.

### Trio Analysis

When a multi-sample VCF with trio configuration is provided:
- **PS2** (de novo): proband carries variant, both parents hom-ref, all
  pass DP ≥ 10 / GQ ≥ 20.
- **PM6** (assumed de novo): partial parental data; mutually exclusive
  with PS2.
- **PM3** (compound het): SVI v1.0 points scoring (above). Recessive gene
  required (ClinGen GDV, or OMIM legacy).
- **BP2** (in cis/trans): for dominant genes — variant in trans with
  pathogenic; for any gene — variant in cis with pathogenic.

## ClinVar Concordance Benchmark

### Methodology

The benchmark runs `fastvep annotate --acmg --pick` end-to-end on every
ClinVar 2-star+ GRCh38 SNV / small indel and compares the issued ACMG
classification against the ClinVar review-panel call.

Concrete pipeline (`data/benchmark/run_full_benchmark.sh`):

1. **Input**: ClinVar VCF filtered to review_status ≥ 2 stars
   (`criteria_provided,_multiple_submitters,_no_conflicts` and stricter)
   on GRCh38, plus a parallel truth TSV (`chrom`, `pos`, `ref`, `alt`,
   `gene`, `clnsig`, `normalized_class`, `review_stars`, `rcv`).
2. **Annotation**: GFF3 + FASTA cache + supplementary annotation
   directory (`--sa-dir`) loaded once; all 673,660 variants annotated
   with `--acmg --pick` to a single JSON file.
3. **Concordance** (`analysis/acmg_benchmark/real_data/03_evaluate_concordance.py`):
   stream-parses the JSON via `ijson` (memory-bounded — output is ~24 GB
   pretty-printed), keys each variant on `(chrom, pos, ref, alt)`,
   reads the picked transcript's `acmg.classification`, and fills a
   5×6 truth × predicted matrix (extra column for NoCall).

Outputs: `concordance_summary.txt` (free-text rollup),
`concordance_matrix.csv`, `concordance_by_chrom.csv`,
`concordance_by_consequence.csv`, `criterion_firing_rates.csv`,
`rule_distribution.csv`, `discrepancies.tsv` (top 10k
opposite-direction calls).

### Supplementary Annotation Build

| Source | Build | Records |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ClinVar (.osa) | `fastvep sa-build --source clinvar` from `clinvar.vcf.gz` | 4,402,501 |
| ClinVar protein (.oga) | `--source clinvar_protein` from `variant_summary.txt.gz` | 4,554 genes |
| gnomAD v4.1 exomes (.osa, per-chrom) | tabix-extracted to ClinVar 2-star+ regions (24,350 merged ranges, `bedtools merge -d 5000`), `--source gnomad` per chrom (chr1..22, X, Y, MT) | 25 × .osa |
| gnomAD v4.1 gene constraints (.oga) | `--source gnomad_gene` from `gnomad.v4.1.constraint_metrics.tsv` | 18,173 genes |
| REVEL v1.3 (.osa, per-chrom) | per-chromosome split from `revel-v1.3_all_chromosomes.zip` to bound RAM | 24 × .osa |
| **SpliceAI (.osa, per-chrom)** | distilled from gnomAD v4.1 INFO field `spliceai_ds_max` (gnomAD v4 already includes SpliceAI scores; no separate download) | 24 × .osa |
| **PhyloP (.osa, per-chrom)** | distilled from gnomAD v4.1 INFO field `phylop` (Zoonomia 241-mammal score; gnomAD v4 already includes it) | 24 × .osa |
| **ClinGen Gene-Disease Validity (.oga)** | `--source omim` from `data/benchmark/sa_sources/clingen_gdv.tsv` (ClinGen public CSV converted to genemap2 layout, Definitive/Strong/Moderate only). **Preferred over OMIM `genemap2.txt`** per ClinGen SVI / Abou Tayoun 2018: ClinGen uses a multi-curator scored rubric and excludes Disputed/Refuted/Limited classes. Real OMIM `genemap2.txt` is also accepted (registration-gated at omim.org); both populate the same `omim` json_key. | 2,419 genes |

The gnomAD bulk-extraction path uses `tabix` against the public bgz on
`gs://gcp-public-data--gnomad/...`. We tested the gnomAD GraphQL API as
an alternative: it is fine for ad-hoc per-variant lookups, but
**rate-limits aggressively (HTTP 429) even single-threaded with 5-try
exponential backoff**, so it cannot replace tabix for the 24 K-region
extraction.

### Speed (single host, Apple Silicon, release build)

| Stage | Time | Throughput |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `fastvep annotate --acmg --pick` on 673,660 variants | **4,103 s (68 min)** | **164 variants/s** |
| Concordance parse of 0.6 GB bgzipped VCF | ~3 min | — |

(All 75 SA databases loaded once at process start: 25 gnomAD chroms +
24 REVEL chroms + 24 SpliceAI chroms + 24 PhyloP chroms + 3 .oga
gene-level. 99 % CPU during the annotation phase.)

The annotation pipeline writes `--output-format vcf` (single-line per
variant, ACMG annotations carried in CSQ INFO field) and pipes through
`bgzip`. Final output is **0.6 GB** (vs ~25 GB for pretty-printed
JSON). This is the only output format that includes per-transcript
ACMG/ACMG_CRITERIA fields in a stable column position — `tab` format
ships only the basic VEP columns and `json` is verbose.

### Real-Data Concordance (ClinVar 2-star+, April 2026 release)

Truth records: **673,660** · Classified: **627,757** · Truth-not-annotated: **45,903** (variants where `--pick` selected a transcript whose CSQ entry had no ACMG field — typically intergenic / regulatory regions where no canonical-transcript context exists).

#### Truth × predicted matrix

| Truth ↓ / Predicted → | P | LP | VUS | LB | B | NoCall |
|--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Pathogenic (n=79,823) | 185 | 13,558 | 35,802 | 290 | 46 | 29,942 |
| Likely Pathogenic (n=13,989) | 15 | 3,597 | 7,933 | 39 | 5 | 2,400 |
| VUS (n=295,298) | 5 | 269 | 266,995 | 14,930 | 6,713 | 6,386 |
| Likely Benign (n=128,038) | 0 | 1 | 75,342 | 50,698 | 3,550 | 1,997 |
| Benign (n=156,512) | 0 | 1 | 60,596 | 41,745 | 48,996 | 5,178 |

(NoCall = no ACMG returned by classifier; the classifier processed the
variant but found no transcript with an ACMG block — usually
intergenic / non-coding alleles.)

#### Headline metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Exact-match (truth = predicted) | **55.0 %** |
| Same-direction (truth & predicted both P-tier or both B-tier or both VUS) | **63.7 %** |
| Opposite-direction (P/LP truth → B/LB predicted, or vice versa) | **382 / 673,660 = 0.06 %** |
| NoCall after annotation | 6.8 % |

Per-class same-direction recall:

| Truth class | Same-dir count | Recall |
|-------------|---------------:|------:|
| Pathogenic | 13,743 / 79,823 | **17.2 %** |
| Likely Pathogenic | 3,612 / 13,989 | **25.8 %** |
| VUS | 266,995 / 295,298 | **90.4 %** |
| Likely Benign | 54,248 / 128,038 | **42.4 %** |
| Benign | 90,741 / 156,512 | **58.0 %** |

#### Most-triggered criterion signatures

The VCF output records the set of criteria met but not the named
combination rule (the rule is reconstructed offline). Top signatures by
sorted criterion code combination:

| Signature | Count |
|-----------|------:|
| BP4 alone | 162,973 |
| (no criteria met) | 73,925 |
| BP4_Moderate alone | 57,899 |
| BP4 + BP7 | 53,197 |
| BA1 + BP4 + BS2 | 28,220 |
| BP4 + BS2 | 24,180 |
| BP4 + PP2 | 18,767 |
| PVS1 alone | 18,302 |
| BP4 + BP7 + BS2 | 11,829 |
| PP3 alone | 11,115 |
| PM1 + PM5 + PS1 | 3,356 |

Per-criterion fire counts (Pathogenic / LP / VUS / LB / Benign):

| Criterion | P | LP | VUS | LB | B |
|-----------|--:|---:|----:|---:|--:|
| **PVS1** | 22,787 | 3,553 | 1,080 | 18 | 22 |
| **PVS1_Supporting** | 287 | 31 | 114 | 0 | 5 |
| PS1 | 14,438 | 4,770 | 68 | 1 | 1 |

| BS2 | 809 | 104 | 10,097 | 14,611 | 75,813 |
| **BP7** | 19 | 6 | 457 | 47,488 | 33,718 |
| BP4 | 17,163 | 2,501 | 154,123 | 90,974 | 108,069 |

| BP4_Very_Strong | 0 | 0 | 110 | 11 | 54 |

### Interpretation

- **Likely_benign recall jumped from 3 % → 42 %** between earlier and
  current runs. The driver is BP7 firing 81,206 times (47K LB +
  34K B) on synonymous / deep-intronic variants once SpliceAI and PhyloP
  data were loaded — exactly the Walker 2023 calibration combining
  SpliceAI ≤ 0.2 and PhyloP < 2.0.
- **PVS1 firing 5×** higher than before (5K → 26K Pathogenic+LP)
  thanks to the ClinGen Gene-Disease Validity disease-gene fallback.
  The remaining P/LP gap is driven by criteria that need
  manual-curation evidence (PS3 functional, PP1 segregation, PP4
  phenotype-specific) — those are NotEvaluated by design.
- **Opposite-direction rate is 0.06 %**: when the classifier commits
  to a directional call it agrees with the curated review-panel call
  ~99.94 % of the time. Per-variant discrepancies (382 cases) are in
  `data/benchmark/output_full/discrepancies.tsv` for case-by-case
  review.
- **6.8 % NoCall** is new (vs 0 % in earlier runs). It reflects
  variants where `--pick` selected a non-coding / regulatory transcript
  whose CSQ row has no ACMG. Removing `--pick` and aggregating across
  transcripts would reduce NoCall but at the cost of choosing among
  multiple disagreeing transcripts; the trade-off was kept on the side
  of cleaner per-variant calls.

### Limitations of the automated benchmark

1. **Inherently conservative**: PS3/BS3/BS4/PP1/PP4/BP5 are all
   NotEvaluated. Manual curators outperform any variant-level automation
   for these categories by design. The benchmark measures
   classifier-vs-curator agreement, not classifier-vs-ground-truth.
2. **PVS1 / PS1 / BP7 fallback paths**: when the pipeline cannot
   compute Abou Tayoun decision-tree signals (NMD, %protein removed)
   for a specific transcript, those criteria fall back to conservative
   legacy behavior. PVS1_Strong / PVS1_Moderate / PVS1_Supporting
   firings in the table reflect cases where the pipeline *did* derive
   the tree signal.
3. **PS4 NotEvaluated by default**: the previous ClinVar-stars proxy was
   replaced; opt back in via `use_clinvar_stars_as_ps4_proxy` for a
   backward-comparable benchmark.
4. **gnomAD v4 mid / remaining populations**: added to the parser and
   `max_pop_af` after the audit. The 9 chromosome `.osa` files built
   before this change (chr 6, 13, 18, 20, 21, 22, MT, X, Y) lack those
   keys; impact is small (mid + remaining ≈ 5 % of v4 cohort).
